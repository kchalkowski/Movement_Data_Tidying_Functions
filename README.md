# Movement Data Tidying Functions

This is just a collection of some random R functions I made that other folks may find helpful for tidying movement data

`Neat.Dates`: Takes a vector of datetimes, and returns a vector formatted "MM/DD/YYYY HH\:MM:SS", to cleanly pass on to datetime formats in R such as `as.POSIXct()`
  **What it does:** 
    * Can take vectors containing multiple datetime formats (i.e., some in vector are formatted YYYY-MM-DD HH\:MM:SS and some are MM/DD/YYYY HH\:MM:SS)    
    * Can take mixtures of 12 and 24 hour clocks in vector    
    * Can take mixtures of double and single digits in date/time strings (returns double digits only)    
    * For times containing midnight on 24-hour-clocks, as.POSIXct() sometimes interprets this as a missing time.. and formats whole string to remove the times. This function adds 1 second to 00\:00:00 times to prevent this
  **Requirements of date string format:**
    * Organized as "date time" (ie 2023-02-14 05\:55:02 not 05\:55:02 2023-02-14)
    * Delimiters in dates are all same (ie 2023-02-13 OR 2023/02/13, NOT 2023/02-13)
    * Delimiters in times are colons
    * Dates are organized by month-day-year
